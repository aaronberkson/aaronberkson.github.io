<h2>LOG ENTRY: SOL 6</h2>
<h3><p>Let&rsquo;s see&hellip; where do I begin?</p>
<p>The Ares Program. Mankind reaching out to Mars to send people to another planet for the very first time and expand the horizons of humanity blah, blah, blah. The Ares 1 crew did their thing and came back heroes. They got the parades and fame and love of the world.</p>
<p>Ares 2 did the same thing, in a different location on Mars. They got a firm handshake and a hot cup of coffee when they got home.</p>
<p>Ares 3. Well, that was my mission. Okay, not mine per se. Commander Lewis was in charge. I was just one of her crew. Actually, I was the very lowest ranked member of the crew. I would only be “in command” of the mission if I were the only remaining person.</p>
<p>What do you know? I'm in command.</p>
